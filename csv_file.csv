Okay, yeah. This rocked. I'll be on the full course soon enough. Easy to follow, and not too far ahead of me that I couldn't figure out where I was off quickly. Much appreciated!‚ï¨1‚ï¨0
Thank you for all the hard work you putting into these videos!!! They are awesome!‚ï¨8‚ï¨0
I appreciate the free education. It's well paced and information dense, they way I like it. I have a word of advice. When your tutorial video includes instructions on creating and starting things, then please also include instruction on how to stop and clean them up. I now have k8s pods (nodes? clusters?) running on my machine but don't know how to stop and remove them. I'll check google for advice.‚ï¨2‚ï¨0
Youre an awesome teacher. Was wondering of you could do a tutorial on Java EE?‚ï¨1‚ï¨0
I need a full courses from you. Great explanationEdit: Went to your courses page, pushed myself the whole kubernetes free course so far, and I need more. Amazing explaining and practice exercises man, love your content.‚ï¨0‚ï¨1
As always, you produce awesome videos. Thanks for that!‚ï¨0‚ï¨0
I have been looking for this kind of Beginner Kubernetes and you nailed it!!!‚ï¨1‚ï¨0
Beautifully made video. Keep up the good work !!‚ï¨0‚ï¨0
Good job sir. You have really simplified the concept‚ï¨0‚ï¨0
For those who get 'ImagePullBackOff' error and their pods are not running check if your image name is correct or as in my case make sure u're logged in docker so in terminal run: 'docker login'. Then it should work!Another thing, make sure that containerPort and targetPort in deployment.yaml match the port u specified in ur container Dockerfile. Took me a while to figure that out.‚ï¨0‚ï¨0
Your way of explaining is amazing amigo. Congrats!!‚ï¨0‚ï¨0

Ramadan mubarak brother Nelson Jamal. As a developer I need to build projects and list them on my github. Advice: For your free course certificates in my opinion you should make them earned after answering quizzes correctly and not only after watching videos. So the only value I get in my opinion is by building with u a project from start until deployment on github. That said, some theory helps clarify concepts and make answering Interview questions easy. Do u know the developer Praveen Kumar Purushothoman from India and working in london with Progate for learning development. Keep that added value bro üòâ‚ï¨0‚ï¨0

when i type minikube status i can see two notes like yours, one is master and other one is worker, but when i type docker ps i cannot see any containers, i checked docker ps -a too for maybe there is an error on container that prevents it being up but no. What did i wrong? Its about my minikube installation or something else? Cannot find any solutions for that.‚ï¨1‚ï¨1
